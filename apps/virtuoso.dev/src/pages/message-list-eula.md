## 2. License

### 2.1. License grant

In exchange for the fee owed under [https://virtuoso.dev/pricing/](https://virtuoso.dev/pricing/), or as otherwise agreed, the Licensor hereby grants the Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliate(s) (collectively "Affiliates") a license to install and use the Software.

The license granted to the Licensee and its Affiliates allows a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable (subject to restrictions below), royalty-free license, commencing on the Effective Date.

The license allows the use of the latest version and all older versions released.

The specific details of the license granted depend on the 3. License model selected by Licensee. The access to software updates is governed by 7. Updates.

### 2.2. Deployment

The Licensee may sublicense the Software as a part of a larger work containing more than the Software under a limited license.

The Licensee shall ensure (and shall procure that its Affiliates shall ensure) that the terms of any sub-license are in writing and are substantially the same and as restrictive as the terms of this agreement (except that the sub-licensee shall not have the right to sublicense its rights).

At no time may the Licensee include any portion of the Software in any project that directly or indirectly competes with it.

For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not use the Software, or any portions thereof, for a project that can be described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder, a user interface designer, or any project that is intended for use by developers or designers, or has a similar purpose or functionality, except with the express written agreement of Licensor.

### 2.3. Restrictions

The Licensee shall not sell, rent, lease, distribute, assign, transfer, or encumber rights to the Software.

### 2.4. License key
To help the Licensee to stay compliant with the terms of this agreement, the Software may require the installation of a license key. If a license key is required:

* (a) The Licensor will make available to the Licensee a valid license key.
* (b) The Software may raise warnings, based on the license key, when it detects that the current use of the Software by Licensee is not consistent with this agreement, for example, when using a version of the Software released after the license of Licensee has expired.

Please note that the license key does not cover every scenario, so possession of a valid license key does not by itself confer the right to use the Software.

### 2.5. Required quantity of licenses

The number of developers licensed must correspond to the maximum number of concurrent developers (in any continuous 24-hour period) contributing changes to the front-end code of the projects that use the Software.

For example, a developer using the Software indirectly through a wrapper library needs to be licensed, a developer working on the front-end code of a project that includes the Software but who doesn't use the Software directly needs to be licensed.

To define the previous terms more precisely:

(a) "front-end code" is code that is executed in a browser, JavaScript most of the time.
(b) "concurrent" is development work carried out during the same calendar day, regardless of timezone.
If the Licensee has not purchased sufficient licenses, Licensee will be required to purchase such licenses as required to comply with the terms of this agreement, at a price determined by Licensor, but not to exceed full price. Support will co-terminate with existing licenses.

### 2.6. Third party

The Licensee may allow its agents, contractors, and outsourcing service providers (each a "Permitted Third Party") to use the Software licensed to Licensee hereunder solely for Licensee's benefit in accordance with the terms of this agreement and Licensee is responsible for any such Permitted Third Party's compliance with this agreement in such use. Any breach by any Permitted Third Party of the terms of this agreement will be considered Licensee's breach.

## 3. License model

### 3.1. Annual license

3.1.1. **Non-perpetual outside of production.** All the developers contributing changes to the front-end code of a project that includes the Software need an active license. A license is active as long as it hasn't reached the end of the License Term. The Licensee doesn't need to renew its license if no developers work with the API and source code of the Software in any capacity (indirectly or directly).

3.2.2. **Perpetual in production.** The Licensee is allowed to perpetually use in a production environment any versions of the Software released before the end of the License Term.

## 4. Restriction on Modification and Extraction of Source Code:

The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the software product provided under this End User License Agreement (EULA) contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of the Licensor. The Licensee shall not, under any circumstances, attempt to modify, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise alter the source code of the software product, in whole or in part, without prior written consent from the Licensor.

The Licensee shall not extract, copy, reproduce, or distribute any portion of the source code, including but not limited to algorithms, methods, techniques, or any other components of the software product, for any purpose other than the normal operation and use of the software product as intended by the Licensor.

Any unauthorized modification, extraction, or use of the source code shall constitute a material breach of this EULA and may result in immediate termination of the Licensee's rights under this agreement, as well as the pursuit of legal remedies by the Licensor, including but not limited to injunctive relief and monetary damages.

The restrictions set forth in this clause shall survive the termination or expiration of this EULA for any reason whatsoever.

## 5. Evaluation (trial) licenses

You are free to try the Software:

(a) for a limited period of 30 days starting from the first use of the Software in a non-production environment.
(b) for the development of code not intended for production (for example, the reproduction of a bug in a GitHub issue, doing a performance benchmark).
After the given trial period, you must license the Software if you continue to use it, whether in a production or non-production environment.

## 6. Payment

Unless the currency is expressly provided, all amounts are in United States Dollars.

### 6.3. Taxes

The Licensor warrants to Licensee that, for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date, the Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the documentation. Licensee's exclusive remedy, and Licensor's sole liability, with respect to any breach of this warranty, will be for Licensor to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct the non-compliance (provided that Licensee notifies Licensor in writing within the warranty period and allow Licensor a reasonable cure period). If Licensor, at its discretion, reasonably determines that correction is not economically or technically feasible, Licensor may terminate Licensee license to the Software and provide Licensee a full refund of the fee paid to Licensor with respect to the Software.

We provide no warranty, however, for unstable features of the Software. A feature is considered unstable if exposed to Licensee:

* (a) through an API that includes "unstable" in its name

## 10. Limitation of liability

10.1. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software or the provision of or failure to provide support, even if it has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

10.2. The Licensee understands that the Software may produce inaccurate results because of a failure or fault within the Software or failure by Licensee to properly use and or deploy the Software. Except for Licensor's obligations regarding 9.2 Intellectual property, Licensee assumes full and sole responsibility for any use of the Software and bears the entire risk for failures or faults within the Software.

10.3.
